# Lab Setup
In this class, we will use virtual machines to practice with various security concepts and attacks. We provide you pre-built virtual machines in order to perform the labs more conveniently. You will simply download them and set them up on your personal machine. Alternatively, you can set up a Linux environment for yourself.

1. Download and install [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) for your machine. See more here: [virtual machine setup instructions](virtual-machine-setup.md).
2. Download [SEED Ubuntu 16.04 VM image](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12l8OO3PXHjUsf9vfjkAf7-I6bsixvMUa/view?usp=sharing) (MD5 value: 12c48542c29c233580a23589b72b71b8)
3. Unzip VM zip file and you should be able to see a folder. Follow the [VM installation document](SEEDVM_VirtualBoxManual.pdf) to load the image into VirtualBox.
4. Download the [SEED Ubuntu User Manual](SEEDVM_VirtualBoxManual.pdf) which includes the account information, list of software/servers installed, and configuration.
